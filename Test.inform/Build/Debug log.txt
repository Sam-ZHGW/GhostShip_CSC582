Problem PM_UnderstandAsCompoundText issued from inform7/Chapter 36/Traverse for Grammar.w, line 874

  >--> You wrote 'Understand "screw [something]" as "screw [something] with
    [something]"' (source text, line 466): but if 'understand ... as ...' gives
    the meaning as text then it must describe a single new token, so that
    'Understand "group four/five/six" as "[department]"' is legal (defining a
    new token "[department]", or adding to its definition if it already
    existed) but 'Understand "take [thing]" as "drop [thing]"' is not allowed,
    and would not make sense, because "drop [thing]" is a combination of two
    existing tokens - not a single new one.
